        <h1>CNIT-133 Homework 5 - Arrays</h1>

        <h2><a href="hw5_part1a.html" target="_blank">Part 1A</a></h2>

        <p>Create a webpage containing a form that displays an input text box, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select items; along with a script that executes form validation. Your script should validate whether the user has entered data in the input text box, has checked a radio button, has checked at least one checkbox, and has selected an option from the select items. Use a submit button to invoke the validation script, so that the form is processed only when the form fields are valid. If a field is invalid then display a message to the user. In your form statement, use method="post" and an action that can be a mailto or a webpage(displaying that the form has been processed), but be sure to use input type="submit" for your submit button. Alternatively you can leave out the form's action and method, but then you should use an input type="button", along with displaying any appropriate messages.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="hw5_part1b.html" target="_blank">Part 1B</a></h2>

        <p>Create a 2nd webpage that contains a script that utilizes 2 pulldown menus. The first one should utilize an onchange event handler. The second should utilize a button with an onclick event handler to navigate to a page after an option is selected. Each pulldown menu should include at least 3 URL destinations. You could put the link for Part B at the bottom of the Part A page or simply have 2 links (Part A and Part B) on the cover page.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2><a href="hw5_part2.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a></h2>

        <p>Given the following table of data about several of our states from the 2010 census, create a webpage that enables the user to enter a state name (full or abbreviated) and have the State Name, State Capital, and population appear in separate form text fields of the page. The user should be able to start the script by pressing the button, "State Info". Just use the states that are given in the following table for your array. Allow for the user to enter state info in either lower case or upper case letters. Note that solving this problem involves a two-dimensional array. Make sure you validate the input for a correct state abbreviation or state name. If the input is invalid then display an error message. Utilize jQuery UI for a button that will be used to display the instruction: "Enter a state abbreviation or name (lower or upper case is ok)".</p>

        <pre>
<strong>State Abbr	State Name	Capital		Population</strong>
AL		Alabama		Montgomery	4,779,736
AK		Alaska		Juneau		710,231
AZ		Arizona		Phoenix		6,392,017
AR		Arkansas	Little Rock	2,915,918
CA		California	Sacramento	37,253,956
CO		Colorado	Denver		5,029,196

        <h2><a href="hw5_part3.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a></h2>

        <p>Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople receive $200.00 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For example, a sales person who grosses $5000.00 in sales in a week receives $200.00 plus 9% of $5000.00, or a total of $650.00. Create a webpage with a script (using an array of counters) that obtains the gross sales for each employee through a form and determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in each of the following ranges):</p>

        <pre>
a) $200.00 - 299.99
b) $300.00 - 399.99
c) $400.00 - 499.99
d) $500.00 - 599.99
e) $600.00 - 699.99
f) $700.00 - 799.99
g) $800.00 - 899.99
h) $900.00 - 999.99
i) $1000 and over

        <h2><a href="hw5_part4.html" target="_blank">Part 4</a></h2>

        <p>Create a webpage that contains a script, using a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem: Read in 10 numbers, each of which is between 10 and 100. I suggest using and re-using one input text box and displaying a count of the number of numbers entered. Another alternative would be having 10 input text boxes. As each number is read, print it only if it is not a duplicate number that has already been read. Be sure to validate the input, that is, if the number is not between 10 and 100 then display an error message.</p>

        <h2><a href="hw5_extra.html" target="_blank">Extra Credit</a></h2>

        <p>(Airlines Reservation System) A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations system. You have been asked to program the new system. You are to write a program to assign seats on each flight of the airline's only plane (capacity: 10 seats).
            <br>
            <br> Your program should display the following menu of alternatives: Please type 1 for "First Class" and Please type 2 for "Economy". If the person types 1, your program should assign a seat in the first-class section (seats 1-5). If the person types 2, your program should assign a seat in the economy section (seats 6-10). Your program should print a boarding pass indicating the person's seat number and whether it is in the first-class section or economy section of the plane.
            <br>
            <br> Use a one-dimensional array to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all the elements of the array to 0 to indicate that all seats are empty. As each seat is assigned, set the corresponding elements of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat is no longer available.
            <br>
            <br> You program should never assign a seat that has already been assigned. When the first-class section is full, your program should ask the person if it is acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice-versa). If yes, then make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves in 3 hours."
            <br>
            <br> For input, use a form input box and button. Validate input as 1 or 2. Simulate the printing of boarding passes and messages by using alerts.</p>
