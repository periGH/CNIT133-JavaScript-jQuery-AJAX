            <h1>Homework 8</h1>

            <h2><a href="hw8_part1.html" target="_blank">Part 1</a></h2>
            <p>Recreate the 'gethint' Ajax example from W3Schools. Use the php file containing the hints and expand them to include several more names as hints.</p>

            <h2><a href="hw8_part2.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a></h2>
            <p>Create a webpage containing a form and an Ajax script that will receive data sent from the server. The form should contain four input text boxes, for Name, Time, Date (day, date format), and Date (mm/dd/yy format). After the user enters their name in the Name text box and then clicks outside this text box, the Ajax script should access three php scripts on the server which will contain the Time, Date (day, date format), and Date (mm/dd/yy format) and return the Time and Date formats into their respective text boxes.</p>

            <h2><a href="hw8_part3.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a></h2>
            <p>Create a webpage containing your own poll so that the web page can get the poll results without reloading. Expand the php script to include the number of votes for yes and the number of votes for no. The count of these votes should display on the page along with the %. Use jQuery UI's datepicker to allow the user to display the date that they are taking the poll.</p>

            <h2><a href="hw8_part4.html" target="_blank">Part 4</a></h2>
            <p>Create a webpage containing a form and an Ajax script or the jQuery $.get() method that will receive data sent from the server. The form should contain input text boxes for state code, state name, state capital and state population. Use readonly='readonly' for the state name, state capital and state population text boxes. Be sure to include a reset button. After the user enters the state code (lower case or CAPS) in the state code text box and then clicks outside this text box, the Ajax script should access a php script on the server which contains the state code (lower case or CAPS) and the corresponding state name, state capital and state population. The script should either return the corresponding state name, state capital and state population into their respective text boxes or 'state code error' into those boxes.</p>

            <h2><a href="hw8_extra.html" target="_blank">Extra Credit</a></h2>
            <p>Create an Ajax Fading Image Gallery. Use your own images.</p>
